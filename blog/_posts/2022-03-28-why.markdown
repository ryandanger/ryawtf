i wish i knew why you blocked me. was it because of that account, or was it because you couldn't see my name and shit? what was it? because it feels like you threw away everything we did together and every good time and it really hurts dude. i was fine with how we ended things but then you blocked me, so i guess you're never coming back and never want to come back? i guess that's how it's gonna be? i dont know man.

why does everyone always block me? i always knew i was the toxic, fucked up one and i always warn people, but i still always end up fucking hurt. you really have broken me. things to stick around for are dwindling by the day.
